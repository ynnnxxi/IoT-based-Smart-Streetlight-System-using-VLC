# IoT-based-Smart-Streetlight-System-using-VLC

This project introduces a novel smart streetlight system leveraging visible light communication (VLC) technology integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. The proposed system collects environmental information using an IoT sensor installed in each smart streetlight. It employs machine learning algorithms to decide whether streetlights should be turned on or off. Additionally, it can forward data to neighboring streetlights using VLC. Performance evaluations show that the machine learning model effectively determines the operational status of streetlights based on environmental data.
